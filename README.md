An approach to make a computer, a robot or a product think as a smart human think. The study of this concept is called Artificial Intelligence. The aim of AI is to improve computer functions which are related to human knowledge, learning, reasoning and problem-solving.
Implement these concepts to recognize THW Tactical symbols using a computer system in the same way a human interprets them. THW or Technisches Hilfswerk is a  Federal Agency for Technical Relief organization controlled by the German federal government.THW as a civil protection organisation aims to help and support in case of a natural calamity or any other disaster.
In this project we done various research and came to a decision to use Tensorflow which is a machine learning library used for applications such as neural networks and we aim to produce an image captioning software or model which could help THW in performing their tasks more efficiently.
